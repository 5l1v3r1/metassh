metaSSH session plugin for metasploit v0.1
==========================================

metaSSH is a session plugin for metasploit that gives you a meterpreter like interface over an ssh connection. When I started writing this code I just wanted to be able to cleanly reverse pivot over ssh from within metasploit but I guess I got a bit carried away. 


Features
--------

* Multi-channel
* SFTP over same connection
* Pivoting & reverse pivoting via "route"
* Scriptable
* Supports post-exploitation modules
* Meterpreter-like api 

Example
-------

Here is an example of using metaSSH to pivot through an ssh host at 192.168.56.4 to run psexec on a win2k box at 192.168.57.4, inside the internal subnet. The reverse tcp payload then reverse pivots (automagically) through our ssh box to give us a shell.

Installation
------------

Make sure you are running the **latest** version of metasploit from github, metaSSH requires recent fixes to the bundled net/ssh library.

    git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework.git

Get the latest version of metaSSH

    git clone git@github.com:dirtyfilthy/metassh.git

Copy meta_ssh.rb & the meta\_ssh directory to your metasploit plugins directory

    cp -r meta_ssh.rb meta_ssh ~/metasploit/plugins

Usage
-----

After installation in msfconsole run "load meta\_ssh" to load the plugin. Two new exploit modules and one new payload module will become available. The exploits "exploits/multi/ssh/login\_password" & "exploits.multi/ssh/pubkey" both let you login to an ssh server through different means and are fairly self explanatory. The payload for each of these must be "payloads/singles/ssh/metassh_session" which will spawn metaSSH.
